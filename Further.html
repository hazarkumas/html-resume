<h2>Professional Experience (Continued)</h2>


<h3>Badal Tunnel | ONUR Taahhut ve Insaat | Amasya, Turkey | Role: Senior Tunnel Engineer (2017 - 2018) </h3>
    <p>
        This was the first tunnel project of the contractor company. It was a 12 m diameter highway tunnel in brittle hard rock conditions. 
        This role included preparation of reasoned reports, educating junior engineers on NATM/SEM tunneling, deciding ground support type 
        according to real-time rockmass observations, and company representation at Turkish General Directorate of Highways level.

<h3>Ordu-Mesudiye Highway | Titan Machinery and Construction | Ordu, Turkey | Role: Tunnel Engineer (2014 - 2017)</h3>
    <p>
        I was one of the shift engineers on the site and mainly focused on evaluating rockmass conditions through geological face 
        mapping. There were three 40' diameter highway tunnels with a total length of 3 miles. Challenges faced during project included 
        preserving the tunnel periphery/preventing overbreak in highly brittle syenite during blasting, choosing correct ground support 
        for expansive pockets in rock which weren't detected in the geotechnical exploration. Furthermore, face collapses have been 
        encountered in this project due to the unexpected ground conditions. I was responsible from reconstruction of the collapsed tunnel 
        faces. I have been assigned to characterize rockmass, observe soft ground and mix face conditions, and select ground support type 
        for the rest of the project due to my decision making skills before the collapse.

<h3>Various Construction Projects | Eser Academy OHS | Ankara, Turkey | Role: Responsible Manager (2013 - 2014)</h3>
    <p> 
        As a certified occupational health and safety (OHS) specialist by the Turkish Ministry of Labor and Social Security (TMLSS), I worked as
        a responsible manager to coordinate the OHS operations of the Eser Academy OHS. I managed both client communications and field operations 
        leading two separate teams. I was the person of contact for all bureaucratic communication at the TMLSS level.

<h3>Hekimhan Iron Open Pit Mine | Maxore Mining Inc. | Malatya, Turkey | Role: Site Engineer (2011 - 2013) </h3>
    <p>
        Started my career as a site engineer in open iron mining, I worked on operations planning, ore enrichment processes 
        with mobile machinery (jaw crushers, magnetic separators, etc.) and geological investigation. The site was containing magnetite, 
        hematite and maghemite. It was part of a larger shield formation that contains fluorite, malachite, azurite, silver, and gold 
        in the deeper sections.

<h2>Internships in the USA</h2>

<h3>Three Rivers Protection and Overflow Reduction Tunnel | Forth Wayne City Utilities | Forth Wayne, Indiana | Lane Construction | 2020 | Contract Value: $188M | Role: Shift Engineer </h3>
    <p>
        The 3RPORT project included consolidation sewers, nine drop shafts, and a deep rock tunnel to collect and convey combined sewer overflows 
        (CSOs) from 22 outfalls along the St. Mary's and Maumee Rivers. The tunnel depth is 200 to 250 feet below the ground surface. It was a 
        segmentally lined tunnel constructed with a slurry TBM under high hydrostatic pressure in limestone/dolomite. The tunnel is approximately 
        5 miles long and 15 feet in diameter. I joined this project as an intern and collected data for my master's thesis. I also helped with 
        construction activities as a shift engineer.

<h3>Westside Purple Line Subway Extension | LA Metro | Los Angeles, California | Traylor Brothers | 2019 | Contract Value: $1.9B | Role: Heading Engineer</h3>
    <p>
        This project adds 3.92 miles to the Purple Line, beginning at the Wilshire Center to Westwood. The twin tunnel alignment is beneath 
        Wilshire Boulevard, and underground stations are at Wilshire/La Brea, Wilshire/Fairfax, and Wilshire/La Cienega. The tunnels, mined 
        by two earth pressure balance (EPB) tunnel boring machines (TBM), are 35,750 linear feet long with an inner diameter of 18 feet. The 
        tunnels cross through an old oil and gas production area. Also, LA tar pits are nearby. Mining in challenging ground conditions 
        (sticky soils, organic materials, hazardous gasses, etc.) was the main challenge during this project. I joined this project 
        as an intern and carried out the responsibilities of a heading engineer. He also supervised the segmental liner construction quality
        and kept records of gas pockets encountered during mining per the contractual requirements.
