        <h3>Eagle Mountain - Woodfibre Gas Pipeline | Fortis BC | Squamish, BC | 2021 - Ongoing | Contract Value: $251M | Project Status: Under Construciton |Role: Designer / EOR Rep - Tunnel Geologist</h3>
            <p>
                The Woodfibre Tunnel is a design-build project for twin gas pipeleines. The tunnel is approximately 8.5 km long and 4.5 m in diameter. Tunnel is unique in that it includes a soft ground 
                section under Howe Sound and a bedrock section under mountainous terrain. The bedrock tunnel is about 5 km long and starts at the Woodfibre Portal which is the launching point for the
                hard rock TBM. The portal is located in steep and rugged terrain adjacent to Howe Sound. The portal design included laydown areas and portal cuts in rock and soil.
            </p>
            <p>  
                During the design phase of the project, I carried out the slope stability analysis and designed a gravity retaining wall for the contractor's laydown area. Furthermore, I developed a 
                databse for rock joint parameters , created stereonets and identified local and regional jooint sets, carried out kinematic analyses, characterized the rockmass, and modeled block failures 
                within and outside of the tunnel. I also significantly involved in the design of the hard rock tunnel portal and cut slopes. I contributed to the development of various construction 
                specifications and outlined instrumentation and monitoring plan forlaydown area.
            </p>
            <p>
                The construction phase of the project is ongoing. I am involved as an EOR representative and tunnel geologist. My responsibilites include preparing tunnel geological maps, characterizing rockmass,
                determining ground support type, supervising constuction activities and ensuring they are aligned with project quality control and quality assurance policies.

        <h3>Roseville Tunnel Rehabilitation Project | Byram Township, New Jersey | 2022 - 2023 | Contract Value: $35M | Project Status: Completed |Role: Owner's Engineer - Tunneling Expert</h3>
            <p>
                 Acting as the Owner's tunneling expert on site, I inspected the rehabilitation work (rock scaling, ground support installation, shotcreting) and advised the Owner's project manager 
                 on site regarding quality and safety. I worked closely with both the Owner and the contractor to ensure specification requirements were met during construction within the project budget 
                 and schedule.

         <h3>Scarborough Subway Extension Program | Toronto, Ontario | 2021 - 2022 | Contract Value: $5.5B | Project Status: In Progress Role:| Design Team - Geotechnical Engineering </h3>
            <p>
                The Scarborough Subway Extension (SSE) project aims to expand Toronto's Bloor-Danforth Subway Line 2 by creating a fully underground extension. Spanning approximately 7.8 kilometers, theextension 
                will run from the current terminal at Kennedy Station to Sheppard Avenue and McCowan Road. The project involves the design and construction of four new underground stations and bus terminals. As 
                part of this project, three new underground stations with bus terminals will be constructed at Lawrence Avenue East and McCowan Road, Scarborough Centre (located on McCowan Road just north of 
                Bushby Drive/Triton Road), and Sheppard Avenue East and McCowan Road. The SSE will replace the existing Line 3 (Scarborough Rapid Transit), which is scheduled to be decommissioned. I 
                contributed to the development of the database for the line-wide geotechnical parameters. I compiled a geotechnical investigation plan, including determining the location of new boreholes, 
                and field and laboratory testing per international and local standards. He also developed preliminary Mohr-Coulumb model parameters to assist section leads with design. Last, I 
                contributed to construction impact assessment reports for individual stations along the tunnel alignment and line-wide geotechnical instrumentation and monitoring plan.

        <h3>Confidential Project | Role: Senior Project Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                Two tunnels (a TBM rock tunnel and a conventional mixed-face tunnel) were proposed to supply the transportation needs of the Owner in challenging ground conditions for this project. 
                I prepared a geotechnical baseline report for bid (GBR-B) and geotechnical interpretive report (GIR) along with a geotechnical gap analysis to highlight the missing geotechnical 
                information and geotechnical testing for the future phases of the project.

        <h3>Montreal Airport Transit Station Program | Montreal, Quebec | 2017 - Ongoing | Contract Value: $400M | Project Status: Under Construction | Role: Reviewer</h3>
            <p>
                The Airport Station was constructed using SEM/NATM beneath the existing Montreal-Trudeau Airport that will incorporate a new light rail transit network, REM, which will terminate at 
                the Airport Station. The Airport Station consists of underground excavations up to 65 m in span. I reviewed and provided feedback on the Montreal Airport REM Station excavation 
                design report which comprises rock support design for portal and tunnel sections, excavation methods, and empirical assessments including Q and RMR, kinematic, 3D finite, and 2D finite analyses.

        <h3>SWTP Discharge Water Line | City of  New Braunfels, Texas | 2020 - 2021 | Contract Value: $40M | Project Status: | Completed Role: Owner's Representative</h3>
            <p>
                To meet the City of New Braunfels' projected demand in growth, the Owner was looking at route options for the 24-inch McQueeney Road Water Line Project. The trenchless portion of the 
                project comprised a 365-foot long, 42-inch diameter Pilot Horizontal Auger Bore (HAB) to house the 24-inch steel pipeline. I supervised the construction as the Owner's 
                representative on-site during the microtunnel crossing beneath Guadalupe River and compiled a technical memorandum for the client.

        <h3>Duggan Tunnel Replacement | EPCOR Water Services Inc | Edmonton, AB | Project Status: Under Construction | Role: Senior Project Engineer</h3>
            <p>
                The Duggan Tunnel sanitary sewer moves wastewater from south Edmonton to the Gold Bar Wastewater Treatment Plant. The sewer is approximately 30 meters deep and was originally built by hand. 
                The trunk liner was built in 1975 and inspections have shown the existing trunk varies from fair to very poor condition and was identified for replacement. The majority of the work is 
                underground using a micro-tunnel boring machine (MTBM). However, there will be multiple shaft locations along the tunnel alignment to allow for the MTBM to be lowered underground to excavate, 
                turn corners, and be removed when tunneling is complete. I prepared all of the jacking force calculations for a 1.5 m diameter reinforced concrete pipe (RCP) and placement of 
                intermediate jacking stations. During the analysis, I profiled the alignment, calculated face pressure, checked for arching effect, buoyancy, and frac-out, and determined the RCP strength 
                and maximum allowable jacking forces for straight and curved tunnel drives in soil, rock, and mixed ground conditions.
